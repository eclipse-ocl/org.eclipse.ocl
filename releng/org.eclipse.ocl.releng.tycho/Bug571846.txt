Goal:

Evolve per-thread EnvironmentFactory with activate/decativate concyrrency to
  per-EnvironmentThread EnvironmentFactory with deferred GC
  
Problem: individual QVTd standalone tests okm but in aggreagte fail
-- seems that some REsource got unloaded
  
  
Oddity: why QVTbaseMetamodel.java but no QVTcoreMetamodel.java?

Oddity: why does a LUSSID getEObject silently return null after a lookup failure?

Follow-on: Eliminate EnvironmentFactory strategy - perhaps not

Tidy configureGeneratedPackages -- ?? scan all usedGenModels

Eliminate waitForGC
