To debug a Maven surefire test failure launch (locally):

a) trim tests/pom.xml to reference the test plugin of interest
b) similarly trim org.eclipse.ocl.tests-feature/feature.xml, org.eclipse.ocl.examples.tests-feature/feature.xml to include just the test plugin of interest
c) trim e.g. AllXtexts.java to just the test suite of interest
d) test e.g. UsageTests.java to just the tests of interest
e) Add the Parameter Name maven.surefire.debug with non-blank to the launch
	see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/975384/eclipse-error-failed-to-connect-to-remote-vm
f) Launch a separate Eclipse e.g. E:\Tools\Eclipse\4.32baseline
g) In a separate Eclipse
	make a Debug Remote Java Configuration to localhost 5005 available
	ensure a Project exists that includes interesting packages such org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi
	switch to debug perspective
	set a breakpoint at something that occurs early / a known exception
h) Run local launch in main Eclipse
i) Once local launching stalls at Testing, debug with Remote Java Configuration
	should stop at breakpoint
	(invoking Eclipse gives confusing irrelevant cannot connect popup)
