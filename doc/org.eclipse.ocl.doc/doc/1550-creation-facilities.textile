h2(#CreationFacilities). Create New Complete OCL Document (new in Luna)

To create new ocl document, user has two ways: 
# New -> File -> Text File, name it to *.ocl => the created file is empty.
# New -> File -> other -> OCL -> Complete OCL File

The Complete OCL File creation wizard is based on existing eclipse wizards and is composed of:
* an **Folder Location** field followed by a TreeViewer area containing a tree view of the workspace contents
* an **OCL file name** field. The file extension ''**.ocl**'' is filled automatically.
* a **Resource URIs** field and four selection buttons:
** a **Browse Registered Packages...** button
** a **Browse Target Platform Packages...** button
** a **Browse File System...** button
** a **Browse Workspace...** button
* a **< Back** button
* a **Next >** button
* a **Finish** button
* a **Cancel** button

# The File extension is **.ocl**. The user can fill the file name without the extension which will be filled automatically to get the follows: **"file_name".ocl**. If the user fills a wrong extension, the file name will looks like: **"file_name"."wrong_extension".ocl**
# Errors at the top of the wizard can be displayed:
## if the OCL File name is empty:  **Name cannot be empty**.
## if the OCL file name is invalide: **"invalid_carater" is an invalid character in ressource name '"invalid_file_name".ocl'**.
## The metamodel uri can be empty. In this case the created ocl file is empty.
