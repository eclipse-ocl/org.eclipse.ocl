Meta-model
----------

What do T and T2 really mean?

Do they match the OCL specification?

Are they meta-modelled usefully?

Are they implemented usefully?

Support library extension so that OCL.oclstdlib is extended by MDTOCL.oclstdlib.

Serialisation/Deserialisation of merged meta-model.

Library
-------

Activate Environment.setLibrary()

Provide alternate libraries.

Analysis
--------

Operation/Property should be looked up with reference to the generic library model

Evaluation
----------

todo

Collection max/min/reverse tests
Numerous FIXME tests
any kind of property
UML library asMetaClass

Deep per-element normalisation of evaluate() input. ? should be in visitVariableExp() ??

Deep mutual denormalisation of evaluate() result.

Evaluation visitor for iterators

UOEs

Synthesis
---------

API method should be defined.

Tests
-----

Check for any NPEs and CCEs and IAEs being silently/correctly treated as invalid.

Non-OCL facilities
------------------

Compatibility support needed for
asLong()
isSuperTypeOf()
EObject
